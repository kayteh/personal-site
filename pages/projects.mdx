# my projects

here's all the stuff i've worked on that i'm generally proud of. i wish i had more here, but...

## showcase

### roleypoly

- https://roleypoly.com 
- https://beta.roleypoly.com
- https://github.com/kayteh/roleypoly

a discord bot to help server members assign theirselves roles without using bot commands.

*stack: next.js, react, redux (fast-redux), styled-components, flow, koa, eris, postgres*

i use this as a self-benchmark project. it is my pride and joy.

### Unity Shaders

- https://github.com/kayteh/shaders

i spend a lot of time in VRChat, so i eventually just started writing the only
sort of code that game really accepts, shaders. i'm not math-heavy enough to
be amazing at this, but here's a small showcase.

### DBOX

- https://github.com/kayteh/DBOX

a planetside 2 match scorekeeping overlay.  
no one with actual web dev experience had made any event overlay
systems for events outside of server smash, this was tuned for harasser derby,
but it could be repurposed for a lot of things eventually, if i continued it.

had the ability to time travel the score events so recordings without the overlay could get them afterwards.

was one of the only event scorekeeping systems that used a central server to keep score, for some reason.

*stack: react, redux, socket.io, rethinkdb*

### LibertyRP

- https://github.com/kayteh/liberty-gta5

a very complicated MMO-style architecture mod for the now-defunct GTA5 multiplayer mod platform, GTA: Network.

the amount of limitations this platform gave me created some very interesting scenarios

maintaining security and scalability required roundabout thoughtwork, the incumbent way was to pass client->server data in the platform itself.
this doesn't actually lend itself well to scalabilty concerns; but the platform does allow external URLs to be loaded for UI work.
so, in order to talk to the client, client talked to an app server, which had RPC ability into the game server, which could pass events back to clients.
this sounds common-sense and roundabout to a reader, but game modders are kinda...
