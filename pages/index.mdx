hey, i'm **katalina**. some people call me *kata* or *katie*.

i'm currently focussing my life on visual interactions; things people can see, touch, and experience.  
i'm also a gamer and hardcore weeaboo.

i write in js, go, and really anything else. 
also proficient in linux and docker. 
i tend to lean into react/redux and i basically live in california style sheets.
