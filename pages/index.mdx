hey, i'm **katalina**. some people call me *kata* or *katie*.

i'm currently focussing my life on visual interactions; 
things people can see, touch, and experience.  
i'm also a gamer and hardcore weeaboo.

i write in js, go, and really anything else. also proficient in linux and docker.  
i tend to lean into react/redux and i basically live in california style sheets.

i made [roleypoly](https://roleypoly.com), i moderate some big discords, i shitpost a lot, might stream educational programming 
content [twitch][twitch], and i have a signature VS Code theme, [plastic slate][slate]. forever an ally.

i never stop learning whatever i can, i've worked on everything from web apps to 
games to backend systems; and i also enjoy teaching it. i don't just like to teach 
code, but i like to teach how to *fail, forward, fast*, as cheesy as that is. 
i embrace failure and falling short, and making the best out of it, because
not every mistake deserves to be the end of a road.
